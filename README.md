# Civ Clicker

This is a fork of the open source game CivClicker, an incremental game by David Holley and Scott A. Colcord. My goal is to not make massive changes, rather to just improve the interface, styling, and fix some bugs. Please feel free to contribute if you want to make similar contributions, or fork it if you'd like to make more sweeping changes.
